# EDA Analysis
I utilized my newly learned skills in Python to develop a short data analysis of a set of data that described income and expense (CSV file: Inc_Exp_Data.csv). I then used that data to find correlations between different values (such as level of education, amount of rent, etc) that determined what caused differences in income and expense amongst different groups of people. 

I used distribution analysis for income to find that in most cases, it’s generally skewed, with most people in low-income and few people with a high income. Then, I used graphical analysis to show how at low income levels, expense levels are usually pretty predictable (high correlation) but at high income levels, expense levels generally get higher, but the correlations decrease (in other words, people with high income don’t necessarily need to spend more).

This data analysis could effectively be used by large money-handling companies (such as credit card companies, banks, or insurance agencies) to target specific audiences and develop models of their own to predict spending in the recipients of their services.

Self-taught myself Python from Udemy course. The code was completed and compiled through Jupyter Notebook. (File name: Income Data EDA Analysis.ipynb). I have also posted the code as a .py, .html, and .pdf file.
